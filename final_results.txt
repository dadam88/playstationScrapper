The game's main feature is the ability to rotate the stage 90 degrees in either direction (but not 180), causing all the dynamic elements to fall in that direction. The stages are grids, being about 16x16 at maximum size. The goal is to get all the colored pieces to disappear. There are colored balls, which are dynamic, and colored blocks, which are stationary and often act as blockages. When one ball (let's say red) collides with another (red) ball (or a red block, or many other red balls, etc.), all of the (red) pieces that just touched now disappear. This repeats until the player is stuck (losing) or the player makes all colored pieces disappear (clear).</p>)
